The concept of the driver model is to have one abstract IOService object
(instance of PADriver) which is the root node for all other objects.
Upon creation (at load time of the driver), the PADriver will be
announced to the userspace to let the audioDaemon know.

A IOUserClient class named PADriverUserClient can be instanciated by
the user space, and commands can be issued to create new and delete 
instances of PADevices. A PADevice is derived from IOAudioDevice and
acts as a virtual audio device. To export audio functions, it has to
have an PAEngine (derived from IOAudioEngine).

Depending on the type of audio engine (one for the mixed audio stream or
one for each individual user client), the PAEngine can have one or many
references to PAVirtualDevices, respectively.

Once a PAVirtualDevice is created, it is announced to the userspace,
just like a PADriver. A userclient will create an object of type
PAVirtualDeviceUserClient which can be used to issue commands specific
to a PAVirtualDevice. See the header files for more details.
